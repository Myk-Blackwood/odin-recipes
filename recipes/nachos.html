    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sometimes food is all about fun, sharing with friends a quick and tasty dish to enjoy outside with a drink or in front of the TV watching your favourite sporting event. Nachos fits the bill perfectly especially if you like spicy food. Although don't worry if you do not like spicy as it is easy enough to tone down the heat - I do because I'm a chilli wimp. They can be made with bought salsa but taste so much better if you make your own sauce (especially if you want to take control of the heat) and these nachos have the addition of chicken to make them a little more substantial.</p>
