    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This roasted butternut squash and pepper soup is perfect for Spring and Autumn. Easy to make, full of flavour and filling, it's ideal for chillier days.</p>
    <p>Roasting the vegetables really brings out the flavour.</p>

    <p>I tend to throw in whatever coloured peppers I have, which often includes a green pepper although I would not use more than one.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>½ large butternut squash cut into wedges</li>
       <li>4 peppers seeded and cut into quarters</li>
       <li>1 onion cut into wedges</li>
       <li>garlic</li>
       <li>2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
       <li>1 vegetable stock cube</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon dried chilii flakes (optional)</li>
       <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>To garnish (optional)</h3>
    <ul>    
        <li>a little feta cheese crumbled</li>
        <li>a few pumpkin seeds</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How to puree the soup</h3>
    <p>My preferred method of puréeing this soup is to use a goblet blender. These produce the smoothest soups. , I used to use the one that sits on top of my Kenwood mixer. But now I have a Froothie blender which is by far the best blender I have ever had especially if you want super smooth soups.</p>
    <p>If you use a stick blender in the pan, you will likely get bigger flecks of the pepper skin, which I don't mind. However, you may prefer to peel the peppers as in the original recipe after roasting if you don't like that. Pop in a bowl, cover and leave to stand until cool enough to handle. The skins will then slip off easily.</p>
    <p>A food processor will give you results somewhere in between.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 190℃ (170℃ fan)/375°F/gas mark 5. Place the prepared vegetables in a shallow roasting tin and drizzle with the oil. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Allow the vegetables to cool a little. when cool enough to handle, peel the peppers if desired, I didn't. Place in a large saucepan.</li>
    <li>Peel the squash, and cut into large junks, add to the saucepan, along with the onion and garlic.</li>
    <li>Add 1 litre (2 pints/4¼cups) water to the pan and add the stock cube and chilli flakes if using. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the vegetables for about 20 minutes or until soft.</li>
    <li>Purée the soup (see above).</li>
    <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper an reheat gently if required. </li>
    <li>Serve garnished with some feta cheese, pumpkin seed and a swirl of olive oil</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Serve and enjoy!</p>
